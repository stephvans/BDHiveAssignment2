CREATE TABLE stephenevanshw2 (OffenseCaseType string, OffenseDate string, OffenseTime string, OffenseChargeDescription string, OffenseStreetName string, OffenseCrossStreetCheck string, OffenseCrossStreet string, SchoolZone string,ConstructionZone string, CaseClosed string) 
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "separatorChar" = ",") STORED AS TEXTFILE

tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/stephenevans/data/Municipal_Court_Caseload_Information.csv' INTO TABLE stephenevanshw2; 
select * from stephenevanshw2 limit 10; 
^C 
cd /home/stephenevans/data/ 
5. Delete both zipped file and CSV file from Linux machine, keeping only the file in HDFS 
rm Municipal_Court_Caseload_Information.csv 
rm Municipal_Court_Caseload_Information.zip

SELECT offensecasetype, COUNT (*) FROM stephenevanshw2 GROUP BY offensecasetype; 
7. Identify the most frequent offences by Offense Charge Description (Show Offense Charge Description and offence frequency count in descending order). 
INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/stephenevans/data' ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
SELECT offensechargedescription, COUNT (*) as cnt FROM stephenevanshw2 GROUP BY offensechargedescription ORDER BY cnt desc;
